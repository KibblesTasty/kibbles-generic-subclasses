Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<h2 id=\"druid-circle-circle-of-growth\">Circle of Growth</h2>\n<p>Druids within the Circle of Growth are among the most direct emmisaries of nature, speaking for the forests and wilderness and bringing its will to the rest of the world. They can be kind and nuturing presences that seek to ease the suffering all living things, or militant wardens that seek to end the exploitation of natural resources.</p>\n<h3>Circle of the Land Features</h3>\n<p>2nd: @Item[ueV11XdpCwkIRUNn]{Circle Spells}@Item[bhvSOKVgA7DzdaCy]{Sprout Seedling}</p>\n<p>6th: @Item[jL10bJpEweFz3sqw]{Verdant Power}</p>\n<p>10th: @Item[cXXbnM0dCFQAvdG8]{Entangling Roots} @Item[AZ0z5mowl2pTF9Qb]{Grasp of Nature}</p>\n<p>14th: @Item[CONLpc4gApCiAUbG]{Nourishing Magic}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","levels":1,"subclass":"Circle of Growth","hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"saves":["int","wis"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["arc","ani","ins","med","nat","prc","rel","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"},"damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ZltBRX3qCs8ZDdsL":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.ygVYgPbJkaH0tH1N"}}}

Any scroll or potion created this way expires if not used by the next time you complete a long rest. You can cast scrolls created this way without a check, as if the scroll was on your spell list. If a scroll requires a spell casting modifier, you use your Intelligence or Wisdom (or choice).</p>\n<p>The number of items you can create this way increases to 3 items at 9th level, and 4 items at 15th level (you can still only replace one potion or item with a scroll). The quality of items you can create increases at 7th level, 10th level, and 15th level as shown on the table below.</p>\n<table style=\"width:100%;height:112px\" border=\"1\">\n<tbody>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6625%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:38.7097%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>Improvised Potion</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:24.8139%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>Scroll Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"width:23.0769%;height:16px;text-align:center\"><strong>Item Value</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6625%;height:16px;text-align:center\">3rd</td>\n<td style=\"width:38.7097%;height:16px;text-align:center\"> Healing Potion</td>\n<td style=\"width:24.8139%;height:16px;text-align:center\">1st Level</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.0769%;height:16px;text-align:center\">5 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6625%;height:16px;text-align:center\">7th</td>\n<td style=\"width:38.7097%;height:16px;text-align:center\">Greater Healing Potion</td>\n<td style=\"width:24.8139%;height:16px;text-align:center\">2nd Level</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.0769%;height:16px;text-align:center\">10 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6625%;height:16px;text-align:center\">10th</td>\n<td style=\"width:38.7097%;height:16px;text-align:center\">Any Uncommon Potion</td>\n<td style=\"width:24.8139%;height:16px;text-align:center\">3rd Level</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.0769%;height:16px;text-align:center\">30 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6625%;height:16px;text-align:center\">13th</td>\n<td style=\"width:38.7097%;height:16px;text-align:center\">Superior Healing Potion</td>\n<td style=\"width:24.8139%;height:16px;text-align:center\">3rd Level</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.0769%;height:16px;text-align:center\">40 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6625%;height:16px;text-align:center\">16th</td>\n<td style=\"width:38.7097%;height:16px;text-align:center\">Any Rare Potion</td>\n<td style=\"width:24.8139%;height:16px;text-align:center\">3rd Level</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.0769%;height:16px;text-align:center\">50 gp</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"height:16px\">\n<td style=\"width:11.6625%;height:16px;text-align:center\">19th</td>\n<td style=\"width:38.7097%;height:16px;text-align:center\">Supreme Healing Potion</td>\n<td style=\"width:24.8139%;height:16px;text-align:center\">4th Level</td>\n<td style=\"width:23.0769%;height:16px;text-align:center\">60 gp</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":null,"max":"","per":null},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"ZltBRX3qCs8ZDdsL":3},"flags":{"betterRolls5e":{"quickDesc":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickProperties":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickOther":{"value":true,"altValue":true},"quickFlavor":{"value":true,"altValue":true}},"core":{"sourceId":"Item.lYKRdNSXvV1eX70j"}},"_id":"BRqTXREUuVR2yKgy"}
